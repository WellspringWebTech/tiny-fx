PHP Framework - Flyweight, Robust, Scalable

This framework is very small and minimalistic, therefore it is extremely fast and scalale. With only 123 procedural lines of code as the core, it is very easy to get ones head around this paradigm and start developing in just few minutes. And the paradigm is Modular and Minimalistic.

Modular web apps can be built on this. This framework is NOT object oriented, but highly modular. Application developer has the liberty to make each module procedural, modular or object oriented.

This version (2.0) is distinctive from previous TinyF(x) on that this version treats modules as packages, all-inclusive packages that can be ported to another project.
